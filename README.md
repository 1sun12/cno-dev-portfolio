# CNO Developer Portfolio

> **Building offensive security tools and capabilities from first principles**

## About

This portfolio showcases my journey toward becoming a Computer Network Operations (CNO) Developer. Each project demonstrates low-level systems programming, network protocol manipulation, reverse engineering, and offensive security tradecraft.

**Background:** Computer Science graduate with 1 year SOC Analyst experience and 6 months as a Cloud Technician (Azure). Currently focused on mastering C, Assembly, and exploit development.

**Description:** Custom shellcode loader implementing modern evasion techniques to bypass endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions.

**Planned Features:**
- Process injection techniques (CreateRemoteThread, QueueUserAPC)
- AMSI bypass implementation
- Direct syscalls to avoid userland hooks
- Payload obfuscation and encryption

**Learning Focus:** Windows internals, anti-analysis techniques, offensive tradecraft

**Languages:** C (implant), Python (server)  
**Description:** Lightweight C2 framework with encrypted communications and modular command execution.

**Planned Features:**
- Custom binary protocol with AES encryption
- HTTP/HTTPS or DNS tunneling for covert channels
- Implant: Beacon intervals, file upload/download, command execution
- Server: Multi-session management, logging, payload generation

**Learning Focus:** Network programming, encryption, operational security

---

### üî¨ Network Protocol Fuzzer
**Status:** üìã Planned  
**Languages:** C, Python  
**Description:** Mutation-based fuzzer targeting common network protocols to discover vulnerabilities.

**Planned Features:**
- Generation and mutation-based fuzzing strategies
- Protocol-aware input generation (SMB, FTP, HTTP)
- Crash detection and logging
- Reproducible test case generation

**Learning Focus:** Vulnerability research, protocol specifications, automated testing

### üß© Reverse Engineering Challenges
**Status:** üöß In Progress (20%)  
**Tools:** Ghidra, gdb, radare2  
**Description:** Collection of solved crackmes and malware analysis challenges with detailed writeups.

**Focus Areas:**
- Static analysis with Ghidra (control flow, function identification)
- Dynamic analysis and debugging
- Anti-debugging and obfuscation techniques
- x86/x64 assembly analysis

**Learning Focus:** Binary analysis, assembly language, malware behavior

---

### üîê Exploit Development Lab
**Status:** üìã Planned  
**Language:** C, Python  
**Description:** Working exploits for known CVEs and vulnerable applications, demonstrating end-to-end exploit chains.

**Planned Content:**
- Buffer overflow exploits (stack and heap)
- Return-oriented programming (ROP) chains
- Format string vulnerabilities
- Use-after-free exploitation

**Learning Focus:** Memory corruption, exploit primitives, mitigation bypasses
